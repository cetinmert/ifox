<h3>VMP signing service</h3>
Since content protection (widevine / DRM) and licensing are very difficult, castlabs has brought a new solution to this situation with the EVS signature method.<br>
Sites that require content protection licenses such as Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Spotify now work smoothly.
<br><br>

<b># The EVS client is published as a Python 3.7+ module, castlabs-evs, and can be installed/upgraded from PyPi with:</b> <br>
py -m pip install --upgrade castlabs-evs

<br><br>

<b># To create an EVS account you would execute something like this:</b> <br>
py -m castlabs_evs.account signup

<br><br>

<b># Signing an ECS application package</b> <br>
py -m castlabs_evs.vmp sign-pkg node_modules\electron\dist<br>
<b>The signing method works only in npm start, i.e., in test mode. Follow the guide below for packaging.</b>

<br><br>

<img src="img/102update/spotify.png" style="width: 100%;max-width: 548px;padding-top: 20px;">

<h3>Code Signing for Windows</h3>
<p>
Navigate to the project folder and open the terminal (Console, CMD).<br>
- First, build the project: <b>npm run build-win</b> <br>
- Next, run the following command to sign the package: <b>py -m castlabs_evs.vmp sign-pkg dist/win-unpacked</b> <br>
- Go to the dist/win-unpacked folder and copy the projecName.exe.sig (.exe.sig) file. <br>
- Open the "sig" folder in the project's root directory and paste the file into it. <br>
- To ensure that signing is effective across all platforms (.setup, .appx, .exe), we need to repackage. <br>
- Rebuild: <b>npm run build-win</b><br>
- That's it. To test, open Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Spotify, or any other application and check if it is working correctly.
