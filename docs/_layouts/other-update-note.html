<img src="img/101update/stroemic.jpg" style="width: 530px;"><img src="img/101update/winstore.png" style="width: 530px;"><br>

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PGJ6GV1C392">IFOX Microsoft Store is Online.</a><br>
Included in Microsoft Store Release V1.0.1.<br>
You can now publish the application you created to the Microsoft Store.<br>

The best part is, we don't need to spend thousands of dollars for windows licensing. Distributing applications with Windows Partner and thanks to AppX Electron Builder we just do the packaging Microsoft takes care of the licensing for us.
Nice way to distribute app for windows in the cheapest and licensed way official way. üèÜüëç

<li>
Removed Old And Slow Fonts Instead of Using Faster Google Fonts. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=IFOX&preview.text_type=custom">Montserrat Font</a>
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
Performance Issues Fixed. Fixed the issue where the old tabs go into the background while the tabs are active.<br>
An active tab is in the foreground and other open tabs are put to sleep and wait in the background. Tabs in the Background continue to work so that they do not crash, but do not consume high power.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
While designing the new theme Opera, I saw that there were too many UIs and design errors in the infrastructure. These bugs have been fixed. a new structure that works more efficiently and faster.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
BUG: page load feedback button not working properly. cancel reload commands are not updating. this issue has been resolved.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/releases/tag/v25.3.0%2Bwvcus">Electron v25.3.0</a> has been updated to the latest version.
</li>


<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
BUG: bookmarks don't work. If bookmarks are registered in other page transitions, this problem has been resolved whether it is active or not.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
UPDATE: When the vpn plugin page is opened in the new opera design, its position is reversed.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>

<li>
Advanced tab management. dividing tabs into groups and further detailing.<br>
BUG: It would continue in a simple order while creating tabs. now when creating tabs, where to open and which tab is closest to it, the new tab starts next to the rate and the tabs follow each other in order.<br>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/releases/tag/v25.3.1%2Bwvcus">Electron v25.3.1</a> has been updated to the latest version.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
The problem of tab management mismatch in the system page module has been resolved. what's this going on? For security reasons, the system pages do not work on the main source like the normal url website. We have separated it and updated it so that there is no security vulnerability. but due to this reason, some design operational errors occurred and these problems were resolved.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
Some parts were not linked to the multilingual system. for macs; translations of the top shortcut tools section of the application have been added. this issue has been fixed.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
Turkish page url names. English names are now used globally instead of Turkish and fixed page url names will not be translated.<br> example ifox://yeni-sekme -> ifox://new-tab
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
Added new page source view protocol. the old one was pretty bad and was working via caching. There was no url separation and multi-use, only prepared. now chrome view-source:domain-name.com was rendered and cached without the old ifox://view-source domain definition.
</li>

<li style="list-style: none;"><br></li>
<li>
Pick up where you left off: new group tabs, when you close and reopen the app, the tabs won't open in the group. The aim is to maintain order and when the application is closed and reopened, the group will continue from where it left off with tabs. The bug in this new group tab feature has been fixed.
