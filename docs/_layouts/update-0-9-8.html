<h3>What Is Widevine?</h3>
<p>Widevine is a proprietary digital rights management technology used by Google's Google Chrome and Firefox web browsers, Android MediaDRM, Android TV, and other consumer electronics devices.<br>
Electron does not normally support Widevine. Youtube, spotify and many platforms use this system.</p>

<div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative overflow-auto"><pre><code>Thousands of changes, bug fixes and corrections have been made as a result of repeated tests and trials on all operating systems.
After a while, we could no longer take note of the changes made :D because there was a lot of trial and error.

+250 bug fixed, +1000 changes
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Detected Issues</h3>
<p><strong>Enable Spotify Web player, Spotify widevine issue;</strong><br>
This problem was solved by creating the new electron Widevine infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify does not work properly on windows and mac operating systems;</strong><br>
This issue has not been resolved yet. Since Spotify has a complex and old infrastructure, it becomes difficult to support.<br>
But in the test results, we observed that it works very well in the linux operating system.<br>
We would like our windows and mac users to give us feedback if spotify is working properly.</p>
